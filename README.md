# ConUHacks2024

The #### is a project aimed at enhancing accessibility by introducing a virtual mouse that is controlled by a webcam or a voice command functionality for actions and screen navigation using a grid-based system. Leveraging the power of computer vision, the project utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand-tracking, enabling users to control the virtual mouse through hand gestures. Additionally, voice commands are supported through the integration of SpeechRecognition and PyAudio.

## Key Dependencies

## Acknowledgments

This project wouldn't have been possible without the incredible work of the following open-source libraries:

- [OpenCV-Python](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python): A versatile computer vision library that played a key role in implementing hand-tracking for our virtual mouse.

- [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe): We utilized MediaPipe for its efficient and accurate hand-tracking capabilities, enhancing the precision of our virtual mouse control.

- [PyAutoGUI](https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui): PyAutoGUI facilitated the automation of on-screen mouse movements and clicks, contributing to the overall functionality of our accessibility assistant.

- [SpeechRecognition](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition): This library enabled seamless integration of voice commands, allowing users to interact with the virtual mouse using spoken instructions.

- [PyAudio](https://github.com/intxcc/pyaudio): PyAudio played a crucial role in capturing and processing audio input, making voice command recognition possible in our project.

- [pynput](https://github.com/moses-palmer/pynput): Pynput provided essential tools for controlling and monitoring input devices, enhancing the overall user experience of our virtual accessibility assistant.
